# Give-a-Breath
This repo includes all necessary software files and manuals for team Zephyr's Ventilator and Oxygen Concentrator prototype from the Give a Breath Challenge initiated by Fraunhofer and Munich Re.

The Give-a-Breath Challenge was designed to identify the best designs and blueprints to enable immediate production of emergency ventilation in third-world countries as a response to COVID-19. (For more information about the competition, visit <a href="https://www.munichre.com/landingpage/en/giveabreath.html#-1922407806">this link</a>.

My team of colleagues emerged as one of three finalists for developing non-invasive ventilators and oxygen concentration devices. The systems for both the ventilator and concentrator were accomplished using multiple Arduinos and coded entirely in C/C++.
